## Deployment

I deployed this Django application on Heroku, taking advantage of its integration with GitHub. Here's a step-by-step overview of my deployment process:

1. **Heroku app creation**:
   I accessed my Heroku dashboard, navigated to “New,” and selected “Create new app.” Then, I picked a unique name for the app and chose the correct region.

2. **GitHub integration**:
   On the app’s “Deploy” tab, I chose GitHub as the deployment method. I linked my GitHub account and selected the repository with my Django app.

3. **Environment configuration**:
   In the "Settings" tab, I clicked on "Reveal Config Vars" and added the necessary environment variables:

- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: My Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: My Cloudinary API secret
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: My Cloudinary cloud name
- `DATABASE_URL`: The URL provided by Code Institute for the database
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`: My default email address used with Gmail
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`: My email host password with Gmail
- `EMAIL_HOST_USER`: My email address with Gmail
- `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY`: My Mailchimp API key
- `MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID`: My Mailchimp audience ID
- `MAILCHIMP_REGION`: My Mailchimp region
- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: My Stripe public key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: My Stripe secret key
- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`: My Stripe webhooks secret

4. **Database configuration**:
   Since my database is supplied by Code Institute, I verified that the `DATABASE_URL` in Config Vars was correctly configured with the provided database URL. In my Django settings, I ensured this environment variable was used to set up the database connection.

5. **Buildpack configuration**:
   In the “Settings” tab, I navigated to the “Buildpacks” section, clicked “Add buildpack,” and chose “heroku/python.”

6. **Deployment configuration**:
   On the “Deploy” tab, under “Deployment method,” I verified that GitHub was chosen. In the “App connected to GitHub” section, I made sure my repository was linked.

7. **Manual deploy**:
   I scrolled down to the “Manual deploy” section, selected the main branch, and clicked “Deploy Branch.”

8. **Verify deployment**:
   After the deployment was complete, I clicked “View” to open the app and confirm it was functioning properly.

## Forking

If you'd like to fork this repository and run it locally, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository: [Everpast](https://github.com/alexstrauch/everpast)
   - In the top-right corner of the page, click the "Fork" button.
   - This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**:
   - On your forked repository page, click the "Code" button and copy the URL.
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```
     git clone [URL you just copied]
     ```
   - This creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.

3. **Set up virtual environment**:
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```
     cd [project directory name]
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. **Install dependencies**:
   - With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `env.py` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following variables (replace with your actual values):
     ```
     SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
     DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your_email_address
     EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_host_password
     EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email_host_user
     MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_mailchimp_api_key
     MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID=your_mailchimp_audience_id
     MAILCHIMP_REGION=your_mailchimp_region
     STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
     STRIPE_WH_SECRET=your_stripe_wh_secret
     DEBUG=True
     ```

    
    Important notes: 
    - Make sure to set `DEBUG=True` for local development and testing in `env.py`. This should be set to `DEBUG=False` in production / when the app is live.
    - Remember to never commit the `env.py` file or any sensitive information to version control. If you plan to deploy your fork, make sure to set up the necessary environment variables in your deployment environment.

6. **Apply Migrations**:
   - Run the following commands to apply database migrations:
     ```
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

7. **Run the development server**:
   - Start the Django development server:
     ```
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view the application.
